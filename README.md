# 🧑‍🔧 Dr. Technolust

Welcome to the digital lair of a self-hosting sorcerer, automation junkie, and retro revivalist. I conjure stacks, tame containers, and breathe new life into old-school roms — all from my Unraid-powered command center.

I build 🔧, break 💥, and rebuild 🧬 smarter. Whether it's orchestrating secure cloud-native workflows, designing interactive dashboards, or crafting pixel-perfect emulation scripts — if it can be themed, automated, or containerized… I’m deep in it.
